# Contact_App
This is a simple React Native application that allows users to search and display a list of contacts. The app fetches the device's contacts using the Expo Contacts API and provides a search functionality to filter the contacts based on the entered text.

# Features
Search contacts: Users can enter text in the search input to filter the contacts based on the contact names.
Modal view: When a contact is selected from the list, a modal is displayed showing the contact's name and phone number (if available).
